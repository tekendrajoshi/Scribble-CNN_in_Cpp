# skribloo
Skribloo is an interactive sketch recognition game where players draw on a digital canvas, and a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) predicts the object in real-time.
Inspired by Google’s Quick, Draw!, the project was built entirely from scratch in C++ — implementing forward propagation, convolution, pooling, and backpropagation without using ML libraries.

## 🚀 Features  

- **✏️ Interactive Drawing Canvas** – Draw freehand sketches on a user-friendly interface.  
- **🧠 Custom CNN Implementation** – Includes forward pass, convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers coded from scratch.  
- **🔄 Backpropagation in Convolution & FC Layers** – Full gradient computation and parameter updates for training.  
- **📊 Training & Evaluation** – Supports multi-epoch training with loss and accuracy tracking.  
- **📈 Visualization Tools** – Loss curves, accuracy graphs, and confusion matrices for performance analysis.

## 📌 Future Improvements  

- **📂 Multi-class Dataset Support** – Expand recognition to handle a wider range of categories.  
- **⚡ Real-time Recognition** – Predict sketches dynamically as the user draws.  
- **🎯 Publish for public use** – Publish a complete app for the public use
