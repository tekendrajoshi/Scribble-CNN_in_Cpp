# skribloo
Skribloo is an interactive sketch recognition game where players draw on a digital canvas, and a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) predicts the object in real-time.
Inspired by Google’s Quick, Draw!, the project was built entirely from scratch in C++ — implementing forward propagation, convolution, pooling, and backpropagation without using ML libraries.
